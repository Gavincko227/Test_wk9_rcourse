## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
### Testing some stuff
fadaf

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
norm <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd = 1)
norm[1]
```
### TESTING Kable - for better table
```{r cars2, results='markup', eval=FALSE, echo=F}
cars
knitr::kable(cars)
```


### TESTING Markup - Formatting Text - does this makes sense
This is  *italic*

This is **Bold**

Here I have some ***italic and bold***

Here I have some `r mean(c(2,3,4))` here

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

I have a list

* first item
* next item

I have ordered items

1. item1
3. item3
2. item2

The data set has `r nrow(cars)` rows

Manual pipe table (must end with a blank line)

| Plant | Temp. | Growth |
|:------|:-----:|-------:| 
| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |


| Plant | Temp. | Growth |

| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |

The colons below column names stand for left sided centred and right sided in 
first table

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
